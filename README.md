HTML Form: Contains the required form elements.

CSS Styling: Provides basic styling for the form and table.

Vanilla JavaScript: Implements the logic to calculate the leasing costs, down payment, monthly installment, and interest rate. The results are displayed in a table when the form inputs are updated. Validation ensures the car value is between $10,000 and $200,000, and the down payment is between 10% and 50% of the car value. The calculations are triggered by input events on the form elements, and results are updated in real-time without the need for a submit button.

The formula used in the JavaScript code is based on the standard formula for calculating the monthly payment on a loan or lease, which is derived from the annuity formula.
